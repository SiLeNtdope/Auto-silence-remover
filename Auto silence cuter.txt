Before doing the real editing, you first cut out the "dead space" which is typically silence. This is known as a "first pass". Cutting these is a boring task, especially if the video is very long.

auto-editor path/to/your/video.mp4
Installing
pip install auto-editor
See Installing for additional information.

Cutting
Change the pace of the edited video by using --margin.

--margin adds in some "silent" sections to make the editing feel nicer. Setting --margin to 0.2sec will add up to 0.2 seconds in front of and 0.2 seconds behind the original clip.

auto-editor example.mp4 --margin 0.2sec
Working With Multiple Audio Tracks
By default, only the first audio track will used for editing (track 0). You can change this with these commands.
Use all audio tracks for editing:

auto-editor multi-track.mov --edit audio:stream=all
Use only the second, fourth, and sixth audio track:

# track numbers start at 0
auto-editor so-many-tracks.mp4 --edit "(or audio:stream=1 audio:stream=3 audio:stream=5)"
Methods for Making Automatic Cuts
The --edit option is how auto-editor makes automated cuts.

For example, edit out motionlessness in a video by setting --edit motion.

# cut out sections where percentage of motion is less than 2.
auto-editor example.mp4 --edit motion:threshold=2%

# --edit is set to "audio:threshold=4%" by default.
auto-editor example.mp4

# Different tracks can be set with different attribute.
auto-editor multi-track.mov --edit "(or audio:stream=0 audio:threshold=10%,stream=1)"
Different editing methods can be used together.

# 'threshold' is always the first argument for edit-method objects
auto-editor example.mp4 --edit "(or audio:3% motion:6%)"
See What Auto-Editor Cuts Out
To export what auto-editor normally cuts out. Set --video-speed to 99999 and --silent-speed to 1. This is the reverse of the usual default values.

auto-editor example.mp4 --video-speed 99999 --silent-speed 1
Exporting to Editors
Create an XML file that can be imported to Adobe Premiere Pro using this command:

auto-editor example.mp4 --export premiere
Auto-Editor can also export to:

DaVinci Resolve with --export resolve
Final Cut Pro with --export final-cut-pro
ShotCut with --export shotcut
Other editors, like Sony Vegas, can understand the premiere format. If your favorite editor doesn't, you can use  --export clip-sequence which creates many video clips that can be imported and manipulated like normal.

Naming Timelines
By default, auto-editor will name the timeline to "Auto-Editor Media Group" if the export supports naming.

auto-editor example.mp4 --export 'premiere:name="Your name here"'

auto-editor example.mp4 --export 'resolve:name="Your name here"'

auto-editor example.mp4 --export 'final-cut-pro:name="Your name here"'

# No other export options support naming
Split by Clip
If you want to split the clips, but don't want auto-editor to do any more editing. There's a simple command.

auto-editor example.mp4 --silent-speed 1 --video-speed 1 --export premiere
Manual Editing
Use the --cut-out option to always remove a section.

# Cut out the first 30 seconds.
auto-editor example.mp4 --cut-out 0,30sec

# Cut out the first 30 frames.
auto-editor example.mp4 --cut-out 0,30

# Always leave in the first 30 seconds.
auto-editor example.mp4 --add-in 0,30sec

# Cut out the last 10 seconds.
auto-editor example.mp4 --cut-out -10sec,end

# You can do multiple at once.
auto-editor example.mp4 --cut-out 0,10 15sec,20sec
auto-editor example.mp4 --add-in 30sec,40sec 120,150sec
And of course, you can use any --edit configuration.

If you don't want any automatic cuts, you can use --edit none or --edit all/e

# Cut out the first 5 seconds, leave the rest untouched.
auto-editor example.mp4 --edit none --cut-out 0,5sec

# Leave in the first 5 seconds, cut everything else out.
auto-editor example.mp4 --edit all/e --add-in 0,5sec
